  <h2><b>About</b></h2>
  <p>Node.js is a server side platform and is an interface to the Google Chrome’s JavaScript engine (V8 Engine). It was created by Ryan Dahl in 2009 and as of February 23, 2016 version 5.7.0 is its most current and most stable version. It is an open source, cross-platform runtime environment that helps with server-side and networking applications. Most of its modules are written in JavaScript. It also includes a big library of  JavaScript modules that can simplifies the development of web apps. Node.js can be run on Windows, OS X and Linux.</p>

  <h3><b>Why is everyone talking about Node.js? And why is it so popular?</b></h3>
  <p>First of all, Node.js uses JavaScript as its only language. It uses JavaScript on the server and client side. So in order to use Node.js, developers only have to know one language.
  And because its uses JavaScript many developers have an easy time transitioning over to Node.js since JavaScript is widely used in web development.</p>

  <p>
  Node.js is also very lightweight because it uses an event-driven architecture, meaning that every call and operations is a chain of asynchronous callbacks. Unlike other traditional server side languages, it operates on a single-thread only. That’s where Node.js main feature lies, it uses so called non-blocking I/O calls. Which means that when an activity is taking to long to finish, it puts all the related files aside until the results are ready and returned via a callback function. So instead of waiting until the system has the files ready, this callback feature is invoked once its ready. By doing that it frees the system from waiting and can run others task in the meantime. This enables Node.js to support up to thousands of concurrent connections. 
  </p>
  <p>
  Node.js is very scalabel, because it uses an event loop instead of processes or threads. Unlike other event-driven servers, Node.js does not have to be called explicitly. In this case callbacks are defined and the servers enters the loop automatically after the callback. Once there are no more callbacks Node.js exits the event loop.

  <h4><b>Start using Node.js today!</b></h4>
  <p>
  Node.js is increasingly becoming popular because it is extremly developer friendly and free!
  But most importantly it is open source, meaning the developer community can identify and address problems quickly.
